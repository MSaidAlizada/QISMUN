            <Typography>QIS Model United Nations is a youth-based organisation run by the student leadership team that focuses on the development of young people and impact on the community. QIS MUN aims to simulate what being a delegate in the real United Nations would be like. QIS MUN is the prime time to make connections with similar students who aim to achieve the same goal of self-development. It provides the golden opportunity for delegates to bond and make networks among each other. </Typography>
